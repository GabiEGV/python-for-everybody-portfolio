# File Processing â€“ Max and Min Numbers

This script demonstrates basic Python programming skills by repeatedly asking the user for integer inputs.

---

## Exercise Description

**Assignment:** Repeatedly prompt the user for integer numbers until the user enters `"done"`. Once `"done"` is entered, print out the largest and smallest of the numbers.  
- If the user enters anything other than a valid number, catch it with `try/except` and print an appropriate message, ignoring the invalid input.  
- Example sequence: `7, 2, bob, 10, 4`.

---

## Features

- Prompts the user until `"done"` is entered.  
- Tracks the **largest** and **smallest** number entered.  
- Handles **invalid input** using `try/except`.  
- Uses **loops** and **conditional statements** effectively.
