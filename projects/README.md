# üêç Python for Everybody (PY4E) Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio showcasing projects completed as part of the University of Michigan's **Python for Everybody Specialization** (Coursera).

This repository demonstrates proficiency in core Python programming, data structures, web data access, and database management (SQL/SQLite).

## üöÄ Featured Projects

I have successfully completed and documented the core modules demonstrating **Web Data Access, Databases, and ETL Pipeline integration.**

| Project | Description | Key Skills |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Email Network Analysis (M05)** | A complete **Data Pipeline (ETL)** project that cleans, normalizes (SQLite), and visualizes a large email corpus using D3.js. | **ETL**, **Normalization**, **SQL**, D3.js |
| **Geospatial Data Mapper (M04)** | Uses an external API to geocode addresses, storing the results in a SQLite database and visualizing them on an interactive web map. | **API Integration**, **SQLite**, **JSON**, Data Persistence |
| **HTML Comment Scraper (M03)** | A script using BeautifulSoup to parse an HTML page, extract numerical data from specific tags, and calculate a total sum. | **Web Scraping**, `BeautifulSoup`, HTTP Requests |
